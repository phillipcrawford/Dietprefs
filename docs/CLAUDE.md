# Dietprefs - Project Context

**What it is**: Food discovery app that filters restaurants by dietary preferences (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.). Supports dual-user mode.

---

## Current Stack

**Backend** (Production at https://dietprefs-production.up.railway.app):
- Python FastAPI + PostgreSQL on Railway
- 20 test vendors, 140 menu items with 33 dietary flags each
- Optimized with SQL filtering and eager loading (Oct 2025)

**Android Client**:
- Jetpack Compose + Retrofit (MVVM)
- Location services (Google Play Services)
- Client-side caching for instant sorting

**Not Yet Built**: iOS, Web

---

## Key Features Working

‚úÖ Dual-user preference selection (User 1 + User 2)
‚úÖ SQL-based filtering (AND logic for preferences)
‚úÖ Context-aware ratings (only from matching items)
‚úÖ Distance filtering (10-mile radius with Haversine)
‚úÖ Sorting (rating, distance, item count)
‚úÖ Location permissions and GPS integration
‚úÖ Restaurant detail screen with photos, voting, and info panel

---

## What's Next (No Specific Order)

**UX Improvements**:
- Welcome/onboarding screen
- Make distance radius user-configurable (currently hardcoded 10mi)

**Backend**:
- Image uploads (S3/Cloudinary integration)
- More realistic seed data (1000+ vendors)

**Future Platforms**:
- iOS app (SwiftUI)
- Web app (React/Vue)

## Recent Work (Reverse Chronological)

### 2025-10-03: Restaurant Detail Screen Complete ‚úÖ
- Extracted reusable TopBar component used across screens
- Built scrollable stack with restaurant header (60dp) + menu items (48dp)
- Implemented scroll-based selection highlighting (#ffd24d selected, #cc9900 deselected)
- Added photo carousel with Coil image loading (HorizontalPager)
- Implemented voting UI (thumbs up/down) with API integration
- Built external links grid for delivery/review platforms
- Created info panel showing restaurant details (address, phone, hours, rating)
- Full navigation flow: SearchResults ‚Üí tap vendor ‚Üí RestaurantDetail

### 2025-10-02: Planning Restaurant Detail Screen üìã
- Analyzed wireframe `Dietprefs (4 Third Page Restaraunt Card).png`
- Created detailed implementation plan in `RESTAURANT_DETAIL_PLAN.md`
- Defined all UI components, API endpoints, and state management needs

### 2025-10-02: Documentation Cleanup üìù
- Simplified CLAUDE.md (18KB ‚Üí 3.8KB)
- Simplified architecture.md (17KB ‚Üí 6.1KB)
- Removed phase-based planning (too rigid)
- Added .gitignore for Python/Android artifacts
- Total: 1061 ‚Üí 389 lines

### 2025-10-02: Backend Performance Optimization ‚úÖ
- Fixed N+1 query problem (21 ‚Üí 2-3 queries)
- Moved filtering to SQL WHERE clauses
- Added distance bounding box filter
- **Result**: 10-100x faster searches at scale

### 2025-10-02: Phase 3 Complete - Location Services ‚úÖ
- Android location permissions + GPS
- 10-mile distance filtering
- Fixed rating calculation bugs
- Backend seeded with realistic GPS coordinates

### 2025-10-01: Android Migration to API ‚úÖ
- Removed Room database entirely
- Added Retrofit networking + Repository pattern
- Client-side caching for instant sorting
- End-to-end tested with live backend

### 2025-10-01: Backend Deployed ‚úÖ
- Built FastAPI REST API with all endpoints
- PostgreSQL database on Railway
- Complex filtering logic with dual-user support
- Swagger UI at `/docs`

## Quick Start for New Session

1. **Backend API**: https://dietprefs-production.up.railway.app/docs
2. **Test search**: POST `/api/v1/vendors/search` with preferences
3. **Android app**: Run from `/android` (connects to live API)
4. **Main files to know**:
   - `backend/app/services/vendor_service.py` - Search logic
   - `android/.../SharedViewModel.kt` - Client state management

---

## Architecture Notes

**Filtering Logic**:
- User selects preferences (e.g., "vegetarian + gluten_free")
- Backend filters vendors that have items matching ALL preferences (AND)
- Dual-user mode: vendor must have items for user1 OR user2
- Context-aware ratings: calculated only from matching items

**Performance**:
- SQL does filtering/distance checks
- Python does per-user counting and ratings (acceptable for 10-50 results)
- Sorting/pagination in memory (trivial for small result sets)

**Test Data Quirk**:
- 15 vendors within 10 miles, 5 beyond
- Most vendors have vegetarian items (not realistic but fine for testing)
- Need more specialized seed data for real testing
